TF-IDF is the frequency of the term (word) adjusted for how rarely it appears in the collection of documents (aggregated to years and authors in this case). This decreases the weight of the commonly used words and highlights the terms related only to that specific year or author.\n\n\nTo carry out the analysis, I collected the individual blog posts myself using the web scraping method and cleaned the data, the code is available at the following link: <https://github.com/MarcellGranat/economania-textmining/blob/main/scrape.R>\n\n",
