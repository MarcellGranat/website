    "section": "Participation",
    "text": "Participation\nWhen I teach this course in face-to-face settings, I make it as interactive, personable, and fun as possible, using all sorts of simulations and in-class games and activities. In an asynchronous online setting, this is sadly not possible. These activities are fantastic not only for understanding core economic principles, but because they allow for increased social interaction, which helps with learning.\nResearch about online courses consistently finds that learning requires social interaction to be successful. In fact, one of the greatest predictors of success is whether students build relationships with their classmates and their professor. This is true for both online classes and face-to-face classes! It‚Äôs entirely possible to take a face-to-face class and have almost no social interaction. The worst, most useless class I ever took as an undergraduate was a required Intro to US History class that met twice a week for two hours in a massive auditorium with 900 (!!!) other students. It was awful and I learned nothing.\nFacilitating, measuring, and quantifying social interaction in an online course, however, is fraught with difficulty. I do not want to create an inorganic forum where you must do things like leave two comments of at least 15 words every week, or other things that begin to approach busywork. The temptation to just phone in participation is too great (I would absolutely phone it in if I were taking a class with similar requirements: ‚Äúgreat post i agree entirely with the premise of your reflection and synthesis thank you‚Äù‚Äî15 words, boom.).\nThere are two elements of this course that are designed to make social interaction more organic and real and also allow you to work through economic principles together: (1) Slack and (2) weekly check-ins\n\nSlack\nTo help facilitate online interaction, we will use Slack for communication. The iCollege forums are stodgy, overly formal, and clunky. Slack is not.\nAccess the class workspace here, or click on the  icon in the header of this page. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Slack, scroll through Slack‚Äôs official demo here.\nThere are two public channels in our class workspace:\n\n#general: Post and talk about general things related to the class and economics in general. Find a neat news story related to principal-agent problems? See an example of a stag hunt game in real life? Wonder why a problem set isn‚Äôt posted yet? Share and ask those things here.\n#help: Ask specific questions about problem sets and other assignments here.\n\nFeel free to create your own channels as well. For instance, if you want to use Slack to review problem set answer keys with classmates, create a channel.\nYou can also direct message me to contact me directly.\nIn general, interact with me and your classmates through Slack! Don‚Äôt lurk in silence in the shadows. (Don‚Äôt overshare either and spam the #general channel in Slack, but in my experience there‚Äôs little risk of that). Do reach out and talk to your classmates (and me!).\nIn other online classes I have taught, I have found that a key predictor of success is how often students communicate with me and between themselves. Ask questions on Slack. If you see someone‚Äôs question there and you know how to help, answer!\nYou‚Äôre not going to be graded on Slack usage. I will not watch to see who is active or count likes or responses or anything like that. If you want to opt out entirely and never use it, feel free to do so. You‚Äôll just miss out on a lot of public class-related conversation, possible avenues for help, and a pretty quick way to get in contact with me.\n\n\nWeekly check-ins\nTo (1) demonstrate to me what you‚Äôre learning in the class, and (2) help me answer your questions, you will turn in a short weekly check-in by 11:59 PM every Monday.\nYou will complete this check-in individually. This is not a group assignment. (It has been in the past, but not this summer.)\nYou will answer these two questions for each session:\n\nWhat were the three (3) most interesting or exciting things you learned from the session? Why?\nWhat were the three (3) muddiest or unclear things from the session this week? What are you still wondering about?\n\nYou can include more than three interesting or muddiest things, but you must include at least three. There should be six easily identifiable things in each check-in: three exciting things and three questions.\nIMPORTANT: I highly recommend writing your responses in a separate document and copying/pasting the text into iCollege. It will be far easier for you if you write the responses right after completing the readings and watching the videos instead of waiting until you get around to putting them in iCollege‚Äîyou will forget your questions and insights if you don‚Äôt.\nI will grade these check-ins using a check system:\n\n‚úî+: (11.5 points (115%) in gradebook) Response shows phenomenal thought and engagement with the course content. I will not assign these often.\n‚úî: (10 points (100%) in gradebook) Response is thoughtful, well-written, and shows engagement with the course content. This is the expected level of performance.\n‚úî‚àí: (5 points (50%) in gradebook) Response is hastily composed, too short, and/or only cursorily engages with the course content. This grade signals that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often.\n\nNotice that is essentially a pass/fail or completion-based system. I‚Äôm not grading your writing ability, I‚Äôm not counting the exact number of words you‚Äôre writing, and I‚Äôm not looking for encyclopedic citations of every single reading to prove that you did indeed read everything. I‚Äôm looking for thoughtful engagement, three interesting things, and three questions. That‚Äôs all. Do good work and you‚Äôll get a ‚úì.\nYou will submit these check-ins via iCollege (they‚Äôre listed in the ‚ÄúQuiz‚Äù section)."

I will not grade these in detail‚Äîif you get stuck on a particularly tricky question, don‚Äôt panic or worry! I provide you with all the answer keys and you will go over the answers as part of your weekly report.\nThe problem sets will be graded using a check system:\n\n‚úî+: (23 points (115%) in gradebook) Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and all answers are correct. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.\n‚úî: (20 points (100%) in gradebook) Problem set is 70‚Äì99% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance.\n‚úî‚àí: (10 points (50%) in gradebook) Problem set is less than 70% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not asisgn these often.\n\nYou may (and should!) work together on the problem sets, but you must turn in your own answers.\nYou will turn these problem sets in via iCollege.\n\nProblem set answer key review\nAfter submitting each problem set, its corresponding answer key will become available in the ‚ÄúContent‚Äù section at iCollege. You should download this and compare your answers with what‚Äôs in the answer key. Check your work, see what you got right and wrong, and redo your work to make sure you understand the questions (though you don‚Äôt need to resubmit any of your work!)\nYou can do this on your own, or you can meet up with classmates to review the answers as a group (I highly recommend this!!!).\nYou‚Äôll report about your problem set review as part of the weekly check-in. Like the weekly check-in, I highly recommend writing your responses in a separate document and copying/pasting the text into iCollege when you submit the check-in. You will forget your questions if you don‚Äôt.\nYou‚Äôll answer these questions:\n\nDid you review the problem set answer key and compare the answers with your work? (1 point)\n\nYes, by myself\nYes, with others from the class\nNo\n\nWhich problem set question was the most difficult? (2 points)\nWhat questions do you still have? (2 points)\n\nThe review is worth 5 points."
