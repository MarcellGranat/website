I had the honor of being invited to present one our current research at the "Data Analysis in Practice" series.

This time, the focus was the used car market, but I was able to present our research to interested visitors with a detailed description of the methodology. We are extremely proud of this study because it combines the modern machine learning tools and survival analysis in a complex way to answer a research question that is important to everyone.

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding-top: 64.28%; /* 16:9 Aspect Ratio */
}

.responsive-iframe {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border: none;
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("IMG_3308.jpg")
```

The enclosed slideshow helps you understand the intuition behind the models and why each methodological step is justified.
